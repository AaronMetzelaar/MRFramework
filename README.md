# Mixed Reality Framework for Interactive Simulations

## Introduction
This framework enables the development of interactive simulations in Mixed Reality (MR) environments using projection systems and physical object detection. It integrates projection technology with camera systems for real-time interaction with tangible objects.

The framework contains multiple steps to create the MR simulation: calibration, initialization and detection. These steps are also separated in the source files. A demo simulation using the framework can be found [here](https://github.com/AaronMetzelaar/MRTemplate/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/RGBDemoSimulation.cs).

## Requirements
- Unity version 2022.3.16f1 (latest LTS version as of writing)
- [OpenCV plus Unity package](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/opencv-plus-unity-85928)
- [Chequerboard calibration image](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/3.4/doc/pattern.png)
